## Overview and description

(briefly describe the project and the database)

## Crows-foot diagram

The Diagram shows the relationships between Customers and their Orders and the Delivery-Address. 

CUSTOMER uses one or many DELIVERY-ADDRESSes but a DELIVERY-ADDRESS can also exist without being associated with a CUSTOMER. 

CUSTOMER can place many ORDERs, but each ORDER is associated with exactly one CUSTOMER. 


```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
    CUSTOMER{
        int id
        string first_name
        string last_name
    }
    DELIVERY-ADDRESS {
        int id
    }
```

## Examples of data in the database

For the people, skills, and roles tables, provide a description of each table and it's contents. Then provide a listing of the entire table.

### People table

The *people* table contains elements that describe people's personal info such as first and last name, email, linkedin URL, headshot url, discord handle, bio, and the date they joined. 

Below is a list of data in the *people* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from people;
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Skills table

The *skills* table contains elements that describe a list of skills with their appropriate description, tag, url, and time commitment amount.

Below is a list of data in the *skills* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from skills;
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Roles table

The *roles* table contains elements that describe the different roles that are available and what priority levels correspond with each role.

Below is a list of data in the *roles* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from roles;
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```


## Sample queries

Let's explore the database!

# List skill names, tags, and descriptions ordered by name


```{python}
sql = f"""
SELECT skills_name, skills_tag, skills_description 
FROM skills 
ORDER BY skills_name;
"""
```


(and here is a sample result from the query)

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df

```


### List people names and email addresses ordered by last_name
```{python} 
sql = f"""
SELECT people_first_name, people_last_name, people_email 
FROM people 
ORDER BY people_last_name;
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### List skill names of Person 1
```{python} 
sql = f"""
SELECT skills.skills_name 
FROM skills 
JOIN peopleskills ON skills.skills_id = peopleskills.skills_id 
WHERE peopleskills.people_id = 1;
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### List people names with Skill 6

```{python} 
sql = f"""
SELECT people.people_first_name, people.people_last_name
FROM people
JOIN peopleskills ON people.people_id = peopleskills.people_id
WHERE peopleskills.skills_id = 6;
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### List people with a DEVELOPER role

```{python} 
sql = f"""
SELECT people.people_first_name, people.people_last_name
FROM people
JOIN peopleroles ON people.people_id = peopleroles.people_id
JOIN roles ON peopleroles.role_id = roles.id
WHERE roles.name = 'Developer';
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### List names and email addresses of people without skills

```{python} 
sql = f"""
SELECT people.people_first_name, people.people_last_name, people.people_email
FROM people
WHERE people.people_id NOT IN (SELECT peopleskills.people_id FROM peopleskills);
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### List names and tags of unused skills

```{python} 
sql = f"""
SELECT skills.skills_name, skills.skills_tag
FROM skills
WHERE skills.skills_id NOT IN (SELECT peopleskills.skills_id FROM peopleskills);
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### List people names and skill names with the BOSS role

```{python} 
sql = f"""
SELECT people.people_first_name, people.people_last_name, skills.skills_name

JOIN peopleskills ON people.people_id = peopleskills.people_id
JOIN skills ON peopleskills.skills_id = skills.skills_id
WHERE roles.name = 'Boss';
"""

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df

    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### List ids and names of unused roles

```{python}

    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

## Reflection

This assignment helped me visualize how the queries work. I made more use of JOIN and SELECT which was a great way to practice the queries. I believe that I have improved significantly from this assignment in that regard. I would like to see how the queries would work on a larger scale database in the future (or my final project). It was also interesting creating the actual tables that are being used as well. It was helpful that SQL gives even the slightest of syntax errors when something isn't working. Overall it was a good assignment.
